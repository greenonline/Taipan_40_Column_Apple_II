# Taipan_40_Column_Apple_II
Taipan for low resolution 40 column display on Apple II (***not*** the more common, hi-res, version).

The Applesoft BASIC code from the book,  [TAIPAN - A historical adventure for the Apple Computer (PDF)][1] by *Art Canfil*, *Karl Albrecht*, and *Jim McClenahan*, linked to from [taipangame.com][2].

The code is provided on both a per-chapter basis and as the combined code. 

NOTE: Some typos may remain - the listings in the PDF are able to be copied and pasted but the terrible "digital/chequebook-style" font and formatting used cause a huge number of "OCR_type" typos when pasted.
